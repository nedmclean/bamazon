# Here we have an Amazon style store where products are displayed and the user can run through the list and find one that piques his or her interst.  

# When a product is selected the user is then asked how many of said product she or he wants. 

# A function then checks the database and tells the user if the amount of that product is in stock and then returns the total price

#If there is not enough of that product, terminal returns a a sad face and a statement due to the lack of product
